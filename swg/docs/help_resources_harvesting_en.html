Help - Harvesting
</b></font></p>

<br/>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
The panel named "Harvesting" helps you to monitor several
active harvesters; they will alert you when harvesters run
out of maintenance, power, or is soon full, and when the
harvested resource is depleted. Harvested resources are
added to inventory.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
In order to use these features you must first define one or
several harvesters and at least one owner; see tips further
down. To begin monitoring, at the "Current Resources" you
select the wanted resource, right-click it and select the
option "Add to harvester panel" at the popup dialog.
</font></p>

<br/><br/>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><b>
Harvesters: </b><br/>
The upper leftmost table displays your defined harvesters.
To add a new harvester, right-click inside the table and
select to create or possibly clone a harvester. Define its
properties: name, harvester type, BER, and hopper size. Of
a defined harvester, only its name can be edited; this is
the same as for in-game harvesters.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Harvesters &mdash; Popup menu: </b><br/>
The popup menu for the this table provides options that are
related to harvesters:
</font></p>

<blockquote>
<font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Create harvester</b>
&ndash; define a harvester for the current galaxy.
<b>Tips:</b> you do not need to create as many harvesters
as you usually put down on a resource; you rather want to
use the feature for "Harvester Cluster" at the "Activate
Harvester" dialog; see below.
</font>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Edit harvester</b>
&ndash; edit the name/description of a harvester.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Clone harvester</b>
&ndash; define a harvester for the current galaxy but copy
all values from a selected harvester. Make its description
unique.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Export</b>
&ndash; write harvesters and owners for the current galaxy
to file, the two are merged to the same file. Use this to
backup your definitions, or to transfer them to some other
galaxy or installation of SWGAide.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Import file</b>
/ndash; import harvesters and owners to the current galaxy
from file. Any entry with a name that equals an existing
entry is silently ignored.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Delete harvester</b>
&ndash; delete a selected harvester; this action cannot be
undone.
</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Harvesters &mdash; Create &amp; Edit dialog: </b><br/>
The dialogs for creating, cloning, and editing harvesters
basically provides the same options, but some are disabled:
</font></p>

<blockquote>
<font face="Arial" size="-1"><b>
Harvester description</b>
&ndash; a unique name or text that describes each harvester.
Examples: "Elite Mineral - 1" and "Elite Mineral - 2".
</font>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><b>
Harvester type</b>
&ndash; this value automatically defines certain properties,
such as maintenance rates, power consumption, and for which
resource classes the harvester is listed at the activation
dialog.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><b>
Harvester BER</b>
&ndash; the base extraction rate of the harvester. This is
the un-buffed value, as it reads at the deed.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><b>
Hopper size</b>
&ndash; the basic hopper size of the harvester. This is the
un-buffed value, as it reads at the deed. <b>Tip:</b> do not
up this value, rather round off downwards; this way alerts
for full hopper are not delayed.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><b>
Extraction Modifier</b>
&ndash; the resource extraction rate modifier for your server. This modifier is used in the calculation of UBER and AER which controls how fast your hopper fills up. This function was added to accomodate different servers having their own rate for resource extraction... e.g. Legends uses a 2.0 modifier. Back on live this was 1.5x the normal rate in the latter years. If you are unsure what your server uses for a resource extraction rate modifier, just leave the default of 1.0 in place. You can always edit it later.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Owners: </b><br/>
The upper rightmost table displays your defined owners. To
add a new harvester owner, right-click inside the table and
select to create an owner. Select a character from the list
or edit/add any useful but unique name. Initiate values for
harvesting expertise and entertainer buff; these determine
the improvement SWGAide adds to an active harvester, the
same as in-game.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
Notice: if you decide to <b><u>transfer ownership</u></b>
of a put-down harvester to another owner, then the applied
bonuses stick on the harvester. This is so until it is
re-deeded, exactly as for in-game harvesters. Remember that
in-game, if the new owner fills up maintenance or power the
bonus is adjusted to the expertise level of that owner.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Owners &mdash; Popup menu: </b><br/>
The popup menu for the this table provides options that are
related to owners:
</font></p>

<blockquote>
<font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Create owner</b>
&ndash; create a new harvester owner for the current galaxy,
either select an existing player or create a uniquely named
owner.
</b></font>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Edit owner</b>
&ndash; edit the properties of an existing owner, but not
the name. Remember that when activating a harvester it is
possible to adjust the owner's Entertainer buff right there
and then.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Export</b>
&ndash; write harvesters and owners for the current galaxy
to file, the two are merged to the same file. Use this to
backup your definitions, or to transfer them to some other
galaxy or installation of SWGAide.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Import file</b>
/ndash; import harvesters and owners to the current galaxy
from file. Any entry with a name that equals an existing
entry is silently ignored.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Delete owner</b>
&ndash; delete a selected owner. Just custom owners can be
deleted, not in-game characters.
</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Owners &mdash; Create &amp; Edit dialog: </b><br/>
The dialog for creating and editing owners is the same, but
the name field is disabled in edit mode:
</font></p>

<blockquote>
<font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Owner name</b>
&ndash; select an existing character of the current galaxy,
or define an owner with a unique name.
</font>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Harvester Storage Efficiency</b>
&ndash; the owner's expertise level in this field.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Harvester Maintenance Efficiency</b>
&ndash; the owner's expertise level in this field.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Harvester Energy Efficiency</b>
&ndash; the owner's expertise level in this field.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Advanced Harvester Technology</b>
&ndash; the owner's expertise level in this field.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Harvester Fair</b>
&ndash; the owner's usual level of the Entertainer buff.
Remember that when activating a harvester it is possible to
adjust this value right there and then.
</font></p>
</blockquote>

<br/><br/>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Harvester Warnings: </b><br/>
The upper center panel allows you to specify how many hours
in advance an alert indicates that an active harvester will
stop. This feature monitors when maintenance and power are
drained, and when the hopper is full. The alerts are visual
and acoustic (optional); the default value is 24 hours.
</font></p>

<br/><br/>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Activate Harvester Dialog:</b><br/>
The dialog "Activate Harvester" is opened in one of two
modes: to activate a harvester for a specific resource; or
to edit an active harvester.
</font></p>

<blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Activate</b>
&ndash; at Current Resources panel, select and right-click
a resource, then select "Add to harvester panel" at the
popup dialog.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Edit</b>
&ndash; at the main table of active harvesters, select
and right-click a harvester. You can adjust the very same
properties that you can do at an in-game harvester, other
properties are disabled but read their current values.
</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
Options and features at the dialog:
</font></p>

<blockquote>
<font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Harvester</b>
&ndash; select a harvester to gather the selected resource.
The list displays inactive harvesters that are suitable for
the resource class; a harvester is listed as a <u>deed</u>,
or as one that "<u>stayed put</u>" which denotes an in-game
harvester which is no pulled up (re-deeded) and it retains
all buffs that were applied on it when it was put down;
this mimics how harvesters and bonuses work in-game.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
b>Owner</b>
&ndash; select an owner for the harvester. If the harvester
is listed as a deed the selected owner also sets the values
for harvesting bonuses. However, if the harvester is listed
as one that "stayed-put" the old bonuses are displayed at
the details panel to the right; these bonuses stick until
the harvester is re-deeded and another owner simply mimics
a structure-transfer. To <u>reset</u> a harvester to "deed"
form, right-click the harvester drop-down list, or at the
harvester details panel for another dialog.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Resource name</b>
&ndash; reads the name of the resource, cannot be edited.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Resource class</b>
&ndash; reads the resource class, cannot be edited.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Misc notes</b>
&ndash; enter any kind of text: harvester location, planet,
intended use of resource, etc...
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Add to Inventory</b>
&ndash; select this option to add the hopper content to
inventory each time the harvester is "refreshed".
<B>Tips:</b> select this option when you activate a
harvester which adds one unit to inventory. That one unit
serves as a place-holder and to stop unwanted alerts; with
the place-holders you do not need to manually add resources
to inventory; neither resource guards or Today's Alert will
alert you for something you are already harvesting.
</font></p> 

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Self powered</b>
&ndash; select this check-box if you apply a "Make a
Harvester Self Powered" device to the harvester, something
nullifies its power consumption.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Concentration %</b>
&ndash; specify the resource concentration for the location
where the harvester is put down, as it reads at the survey
device. This value is used when SWGAide estimates amount at
hopper, which also is the amount that is added to inventory
if that option is selected.
<b>Tips:</b> if you use the cluster feature, see below,
you specify the highest value for the location so that
alerts are not delayed.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
Remember that the estimated amount is never 100% accurate,
there are hidden decimals and other factors that makes it
deviate from the final yield from your harvesters. Thence
you must adjust the value at the inventory no matter what,
and it is pointless to spend too much time on accuracy at
these panels.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Maintenance</b>
&ndash; specify the amount of maintenance that is added to
the harvester. This is also the amount which is added to
the harvester at a "refresh".
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Power</b>
&ndash; specify the amount of power that is added to
the harvester. This is also the amount which is added to
the harvester at a "refresh".
 </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Harvester details</b>
&ndash; this panel reads the properties and bonuses of the
harvester. For a deed its bonuses are pending until it is
activated. If it stayed-put the values are from the date it
was put down, no matter who the current owner is.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Harv Fair</b>
&ndash; adjust the Entertainer buff Harvester Fair for the
current owner before you activate the harvester. This value
cannot be adjusted for an active or put-down harvester;
this works the same as in-game.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Harvester Cluster</b>
&ndash; specify how many harvesters you put down in-game
and let this one harvester represent them all, to denote
a cluster of in-game harvesters; but use it only for
harvesters of equal BER and hopper size. The cluster size
just multiplies the amount that is added to inventory at
each "refresh".
<b>Tips:</b> use this feature to reduce the number of
active harvesters at this panel. There is no need for many
entries that essentially monitors the same thing; as long
as you maintain all harvesters at one location at the same
time alerts and whatever are monitored by just one entry.
</font></p>
</blockquote>

<br/><br/>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Active Harvesters:</b><br/>
The main table displays active harvesters for the current
galaxy. Hover the mouse over the column titles to read the
"tool-tip" texts. It is possible to <u>edit cells</u> for
maintenance, power, and notes; just double click such a
cell and edit its value.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
Any alert colors one or more table cells in yellow or red;
yellow warns that the harvester will stop soon, red that it
already is stopped; either for maintenance or power.
If a resource is depleted the cell is colored in purple.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Active Harvesters &mdash; Popup menu: </b><br/>
The popup menu for the this table provides options that are
related to active harvesters. Some options are doubled at
the harvesters and owners tables, see their help texts.
</font></p>

<blockquote>
<font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Refresh harvester</b>
&ndash; empty the hopper and replenish maintenance and
power. The "add-to-inventory" option determines if hopper
content is added to inventory, possibly multiplied by the
cluster size.
</font>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Edit active harvester</b>
&ndash; open the dialog to edit certain properties of the
selected harvester, see above. Many options are disabled,
this works as in-game mechanics.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Filter inventory </b> 
&ndash; filter resource inventory for the resource class
of the active harvester.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Select current </b> 
&ndash; select the harvested resource at Current Resources.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Select schematic use </b> 
&ndash; select the harvested resource class at Schematics:
Resource Class Use. At that panel you can see which
schematics that calls for the resource class by name,
or which schematics that may use it. If the resource class
is not a <i>named resource class </i> it is still selected
at the right-most tree but the middle list displays the
first super-class that is a named resource class.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Numerical hopper totals </b>
&ndash; select this to display numerical values rather than
percent at the hopper column.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Display end dates</b>
&ndash; select this to display estimated end dates for
maintenance, power, and hopper.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Mark depleted </b> 
&ndash; send a depleted-resource message to
<nobr>SWGCraft.org</nobr> for the harvested resource.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Deactivate harvester (stays put)</b>
&ndash; deactivate the harvester but let it retain applied
bonuses. No bonuses, Entertainer buff, or self-powered mode
are reset. This mimics deactivating in-game harvesters and
reactivating them to harvest another resource but they stay
put at the same location and retain all applied bonuses. 
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
To "re-deed" a "stayed-put" harvester you must open the
activate-harvester dialog at Current Resources, select the
harvester, and right-click the harvester list or at the
details panel to bring up a dialog.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Deactivate harvester (re-deed)</b>
&ndash; deactivate the harvester and return it to deed;
this resets any buff, bonuses, and self-powered device.
This mimics re-deeding in-game harvesters.
</font></p>
