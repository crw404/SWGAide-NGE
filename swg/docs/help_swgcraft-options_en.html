<b>Main galaxy: </b>the default galaxy which is preselected at panels related 
to crafting, unless the current character is from another galaxy. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Auto-update: </b>if this option is selected SWGAide automatically downloads 
resource data for the main galaxy. </font></p>

<b>Time zone: </b>your time zone relative to the international GMT (UTC). 
Daylight saving is unsupported. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>User name and password: </b>your login details to SWGCraft.org. The password 
is stored locally in strongly encrypted form and when uploading data to 
SWGCraft.org it is not the password itself but its "hash" that is used (its 
digital fingerprint from which it is impossible to reconstruct the password). 
During the request for the 'hash' from SWGCraft.org the password is communicated 
on time in strongly encrypted form. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Verify: </b>validates the entered username/password before saving them 
locally. An invalid username and/or password makes many crafting related 
features of SWGAide unusable. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Save: </b>the user name and password are the only data which you must save 
manually. </font></p>

are locked and cannot be edited unless the check-box is ticked.

The "base URL" to the server, the initial part of the link. </font>

The "resource path" is the specific path to the file for exported resource data.
The "%BASE%" and "%GALAXY%.xml.gz" are filled in by SWGAide but the rest can be 
edited if ever necessary. </font>

<LI><font face="Arial" size="-1">
The "status file" is the tiny file at the server that reads the most recent date
the exported data files were updated. This file is always checked against to 
avoid excess downloads of the export files. </font>

SOAP is the path pointing to the SOAP server utilized by SWGAide to communicate 
resource data with SWGCraft.org. </font>

<font face="Arial" size="-1">
Normally you should not have to touch these server settings and they are 
"locked" to prevent accidental data corruption. </font></p>

If you completely erase the content of any of these fields it will reset to its 
default value when you restart SWGAide. </font></p>
