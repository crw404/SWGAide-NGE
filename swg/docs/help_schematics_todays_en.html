Help: Schematics &mdash; Today's Alert
</b></font></p>

<br/>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
This panel helps you to quickly review currently spawning
resources that are better than what exists in your resource
inventory. SWGAide scans current resources which are not yet
harvested and computes their experimental weights which are
compared versus your resource inventory. In low-quality mode
this panel displays resources for classes that are missing
in inventory.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
This panel <i>does not </i> replace resource guards at the
Resources panel. Guards alert you when a resource meets its
criterion, whether high or low, and they automatically check
for news at your main galaxy at SWGCraft.org. This panel,
for your assignees and their lists of favorite schematics
it displays which resources that are better than your stock.
Or you select to do this for all schematics or for a
selected profession.
</font></p>

<blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
Schematic data are mainly obtained from
<nobr><b>www.SWGCraft.org</b></nobr> and all resource data
are obtained from there. This is the data which are submitted
and updated by players like you and me.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
The more players that update SWGCraft the better this panel
supports your crafting; find the ISDroid folder at the mail
section and also the "Submit Resources" panel for manual
submission of one or several resource data. See help file
for <i>Draft Schematics </i> for details on how to update
or submit schematics.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
In SWGAide, often a mouse right-click at a GUI element displays
a popup dialog with various options and features. 
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">
<b>Today's Alert </b>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
When computing the weights for schematics this panel makes
use of the resource classes that these schematics call for.
Thus, computed rates and coloring is done relative the caps
of the required resource classes. It allows for zero-stats
but requires at least one stat for the displayed resources.
See the <i>Beginner's Guide for Traders </i> for a complete
discussion on how rates are computed for a single resource.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
Limits and colors are the same as for the <i>Resources </i> 
panel and this panel displays resources with a computed rate
better than anything in inventory or resources with a rate
better than the "fair" limit. Specify limits and colors at
the panel Current Resources &rArr; Display Options.
For example, set the limit for "fair" to 800 and if nothing
in inventory meets the schematic then only resources with a
rate better than 800 are listed, and then 800 is also the
lower limit for the "fair" color.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Assignees: </b><br/>
To the upper left, select an assignee and for its list of
favorite schematics SWGAide scans the current resources and
displays those that are better than your resource inventory
&mdash; define assignees and add favorite schematics either
at the <i>Manage Assignees and Favorites </i> dialog or at
the <i>Draft Schematics </i> panel; the dialog is opened at
the Edit menu and it has its own help text. 
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
Below the assignees you have created you see more entries.
If you select "Pro: All" or "Pro: <profession>" this panel
rather scans all schematics for the selected item. If you
are new to SWGAide and inventory is quite empty, then these
options may display way too much to be useful for you, then
create one or several assignees and add schematics to their
list of favorites. On the other hand, if resource inventory
is well stocked you may prefer these options over assignees
&mdash; or not.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Assignees &mdash; Popup menu: </b>
</font></p>

<blockquote>
<font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Manage assignees... </b> 
&ndash; select this option to open the dialog for managing
assignees and favorite lists. This dialog is not for other
features related to schematic assignees. 
</font>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Default assignee</b> 
&ndash; select an entry as a default assignee; when SWGAide
starts it scans all current resources against the list of
favorite schematics of this assignee and if a resource is
found that is better-than-inventory it colors the tabs for
Schematics and Today's Alert as a notification. If nothing
is selected SWGAide scans schematics for all professions,
which equals the "Pro: All" entry.
</font></p>
</blockquote>

<br/>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Options: </b><br/>
Adjust the limits for which resources to include and what
inventory stock to consider:
</font></p>

<blockquote>
<font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Max days </b>
&ndash; specify maximum age for the resources to display;
e.g. "2" displays all better-than-inventory resources that
are reported to SWGCraft.org within the recent two days.
This option applies to both HQ and LQ mode.
</font>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Inventory </b>
&ndash; specify a limit for which inventory resource crates
to ignore. For example "50,000" makes SWGAide to ignore any
crate smaller than 50k when it compares resource rates.
Hence this option gives an early warning that something soon
runs out; zero (0) compares against all inventory resources,
also very small crates. This option only applies to HQ mode.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>HQ / LQ </b>
&ndash; switch between high-quality and low-quality mode.<br/>
&ndash; <font color="blue">
HQ mode</font>: 
for each favorite schematic and for its combinations of
required resource classes and experimental weights, SWGAide
computes the rates for current and inventory resources; only
resources with rates equal or better than inventory are
displayed. <br/>
&ndash; <font color="blue">
LQ mode</font>: 
for each favorite schematic SWGAide checks if its required
resource classes are missing in inventory. This feature does
not determine if resources are bulk or superior qualities.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Show Great </b>
&ndash; select this option to ignore inventory and rather
display all "great" resources. For each schematic of the
selected assignee or profession and for all its combinations
of required resource classes and its experimental weights,
SWGAide computes the rates for all of the current resources
and displays only resources with rates that are better than
"great". Define the limit of <i>Great </i> at Resources
&rarr; Display Options. This option is disabled in LQ mode.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Ignore K/M </b>
&ndash; select to ignore resources from Kashyyyk or Mustafar.
Notice that this option does not apply to creature resources
from these two planets.
</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Main table: </b><br/>
This table is populated when you select an assignee so that
for its list of favorite schematics SWGAide scans all current
resources and displays the result at this table. If nothing
outshines your inventory this table is empty. For a resource
this table reads its rate and its improvement over inventory.
A resources is displayed per combination of
resource-class-and-weights that pertains to the resource.
Thus you may see several entries for the same resource,
each of its entries is for a discreet combination of
resource-class and weights.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Columns and Colors </b>
&ndash; for resource values, the rate, and the <i>percent 
</i> columns the limits and colors are the same as at the
<i>Resources </i> panel. The stats that are called for by
the experimental weights are rendered in bold face. Rates
are based on the combination of resource class and weights
of the favorite schematic that the entries pertain to.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
The <nobr>%%</nobr> column displays the estimated improvement
of current resources versus best of inventory as a percentage.
Improvements greater than 5% are rendered at a "fair" color,
above 10% at a "good" color, and greater than 15% at a "great"
color background. If the resource is for a resource class that
is missing in inventory the background is cyan to alert you.
A calculated rate <b>is not</b> the
<i>weighed average result</i> because then <i>all resources
</i> in a schematic must be calculated together &mdash; this
topic and the math behind this is discussed in the
<i>Beginner's Guide for Traders</i>.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
In LQ mode coloring is based on the classes of the resources
themselves, without rate because there is no experimenting
but the <nobr>%%</nobr> column is colored with cyan.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Main table &mdash; Popup menu: </b>
</font></p>

<blockquote>
<font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Resource details...</b>
&ndash: displays a dialog with details about the selected
resource. The dialog reads details about planets and age,
and if the resource is already in inventory the total
amount is included.

<b>Filter current </b> 
&ndash; filters table of currently spawning resources for
the class of the filter and selects the resource for entry.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Filter inventory </b>
&ndash; filters and sorts the resource inventory for
the weights and class that pertains to the selected entry;
that is, the resource class of the selected resource and the 
experimental weights of the filter the resource pertains to.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Schematics viewer </b>
&ndash; select a resources and open a window that gives
a quick display of the quality of the monitored resource

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Creature harvesting </b>
&ndash; for a selected creature resource class and this
option displays two sub-options: <br/>
<b>Harvested from...</b> which displays a dialog that lists
the creatures that the class may be harvested from, if any.
Egg and Seafood are not supported because they are harvested
wherever. <br/>
<b>Browse SWGPets.com</b> which opens your web browser for
the selected resource class. Notice that for generic resource
classes SWGPets displays all creatures.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Organic vs. Creature Resources </b>
&ndash; toggles whether Creature Resources are disregarded
or not when a schematic calls for Organic; using harvesters
for Flora Resources is "cheaper" for Organic.
