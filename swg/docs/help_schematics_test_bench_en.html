This dialog makes it possible for to test which combination
of resources that gives the best result. Fill a schematic's
resource slots and per unique experimental "group" and for
each required stat this dialog displays the quality of each
resource, and it displays the intermediate result per line
and the total result. Replace resources and results.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
Intermediate values and/or results may be decent or bad but
other resources and/or lines may compensate so that the end
result becomes great. Thus, find a combination of resources
that gives the best possible result: see section "Coloring"
at the end of this help text.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
Operate this dialog at Schematics &rArr; The Laboratory.
<br/>
The dialog stays open also if you switch to another panel
of SWGAide, but it is operated only from The Laboratory.
</font></p>

<blockquote>
<font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Open the dialog</b>
&mdash; double click a schematic at the upper left list, or
by a double click a resource at the table of best-matching
resources.
</font>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Fill resource slots</b>
&mdash; double click  a resource at the table of best
matching resources.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
Resource slots are filled by the following:
<div align="left">
<ul>
<li><font face="Arial" size="-1">
if a resource slot is selected...
</font>
<ul>
<li><font face="Arial" size="-1">
if the resource matches the required resource class for
that slot the resource fills it, potentially it replaces
any previous resource
</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial" size="-1">
otherwise nothing happens
</font></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><font face="Arial" size="-1">
if no resource slot is selected...
</font>
<ul>
<li><font face="Arial" size="-1">
determined by its resource class the resource fills the
first empty resource slot it matches
<li><font face="Arial" size="-1">
otherwise nothing happens
</font></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul></div>
Hence, by selecting a resource slot you can try different
matching resources for that slot.

<blockquote>
<font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Select/Deselect resource slots</b>

deselect it. See above on why it is good or not good to
select a slot.

<b>Empty a slot</b>
&mdash; right-click a filled resource slot to empty it.

Notice that best-matching resources at The Laboratory are
not listed per resource slot but by resource class <i>and 
</i> by merged experimental groups. Some best-matching
resources will fit several slots, others will fit just one.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Results</b> correspond to the merged experimental groups
at The Laboratory, but just one per unique combination of
required stats and weights.
</font></p>

<blockquote>
<font face="Arial" size="-1">
Results per unique "group" correspond to and are displayed
in the same order as the merged experimental groups at The
Laboratory's table of best-matching resources, though this
dialog displays just one blurb per unique combination of
required stats-and-weights &mdash; the table of 
best-matching resources also splits on resource classes.
</font>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
Within each "group" the results are lined up per required
stat-and-weight and this dialog displays the final result
per stat-and-weight. This result is not adjusted anymore.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
Within each line resources are displayed in the same order
as the resource slots they pertain to. Each resource reads
the values that it contributes toward that particular stat;
an empty slot reads and contributes 0.0 and penalizes the
result; a resource that does not have that stat reads and
contributes nothing.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
The value that a resource contribute is better discussed in
<i>Beginner's Guide for Traders</i>. Briefly though, it is
the resource's value of that stat adjusted for the cap that
is determined <i>by the schematic</i>; the value is reduced
for the experimental weight of the stat; finally the value
is reduced by its number of units relative the total amount
of units that contributes to that stat (the latter is best
explained by the examples in the guide). The formula is:
</font><br/><tt>
(resource_value / cap_of_schem_res_class * 1000) * 
(weight_exp / 100) *
(resource_units / contributed_units) </tt><br/>
<font face="Arial" size="-1">
For example (66% CD and the schematic's resource clot calls
for 125 units of Steel; totally 225 units of resources has
CD and thus contribute to CD; your have some steel with
CD=645):
</font><br/><tt>
(645 / 650 * 1000) * (66 / 100) * (125 / 225) = 363.85
</tt><br/>
<font face="Arial" size="-1">
As is described in the guide, a resource that contributes
with a large amount of units versus other resources is more
important than others.
Also, a stat with a higher experimental weight is more
important than a stat with a lower weight.
</p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
The final line displays the end result which is the sum of
the stats results; the closer to 1000 the better.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Coloring</b> is determined by the limits you have set
up at Resources &rArr; Display Options for Good and Great.
However, here
<font color="red"><b>
red
</b></font>
denotes a bad value, a value that is less than Good, and
<font color=#FF8C00><b>
orange
</b></font>
denotes a value that is less than Great; and <b>black</b>
denotes a great value that together with resource refinery
expertise will cap the item for the experimental group you
are viewing &mdash; this is unless you have set a too low
or a too high a limit for Great, 960 is recommended.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
Notice that intermediate results may con red or orange but
other lines may compensate so that the end result becomes
Great. Hence, this dialog helps you find a combination of
resources that overcome flaws in one or a few resources.
</font></p>

<br/>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Misc:</b><br/>
&ndash; this dialog, as SWGAide at large, treats resources
with a missing stat in the same way as in SWG: if it is met
once by any resource the result is not penalized. Only if a
stat is not met by any resource the end result is inferior.
<br/>
&ndash; intermediate values and results are computed in
the same way as in SWG: "schematics is king" and determines
which caps to use, from the resource classes the schematic
calls for. All results (also intermediate) are the "weighed
average result adjusted for caps" which is explained in
detail in <i>The Beginner's Guide for Traders</i>,
chapter 8.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Limitations:</b><br/>
&ndash;
it is unclear whether this dialog properly reduce the
result for a stat if it is not met at least once; the
result is penalized but SWG may do it differently.
<br/>
&ndash;
this dialog does not always resize itself properly, this
is for schematics with many slots and the lines of results
grow very wide; you must manually resize the dialog.
