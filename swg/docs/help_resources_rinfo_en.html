Help: Resources &mdash; Resource Class Info & Caps 
</b></font></p>

<br/><br/>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
This panel displays various information about the resource
classes in SWG, currently just caps are visualized. The data
at these pages are compiled from a variety of sources and is
also available at <b>SWGCraft.org</b>. Feel free to suggest
additions or to provide further data at SWGCraft.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
At the left-hand tree of resource classes, expand a class
to display its sub-classes. Currently this tree only supports
mouse clicks to expand/collapse the nodes.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
Only stats that are expected for its resource class are
rendered and their upper and lower caps are presented. The
colored background visualize as well the lower as the upper
cap. Notice how some resource classes within a group, such
as Iron, improve their stats from low to highest possible
for the "parent" class. 
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Coloring: </b> &ndash;
Expected stats are rendered at the "Great" color background
which you decide at the Current Resources panel. However,
JTL resource classes are rendered at a somewhat darker shade.
Creature resource which are not possible to harvest naturally
in the worlds are rendered at a bluish shade.
</font></p>

For a detailed discussion on resource classes, caps, and how
to best utilize the properties of different resource classes,

in the General Crafting forum.
