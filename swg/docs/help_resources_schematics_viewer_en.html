Help: Resource used-by Schematics Viewer
</b></font></p>

<br/>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
For a particular resource this viewer quickly displays its
quality rate for all schematics that can use it. For these
schematics it also lists any competing resources.
Option LQ determines if also LQ schematics that call for a
<i>named resource class </i> that matches the particular
resource.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
With this viewer you quickly scan through your inventory to
review the quality of each resource versus schematics and
versus other resources; it may match several schematics but
should it be put aside as a "best//only-choice"? Or if you
have loads of better resources on stock, easily sift out
inferior stuff. You can also quickly scan through new
resources to see if they are useful for HQ schematics.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
The option "LQ" determines if also LQ schematics that call
for a <i>named resource class </i> are displayed, that is
if it matches the particular resource. This way you quickly
see if a certain resource might have another use.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
This viewer does not replace the Schematics &rArr; Today's
Alert or The Laboratory. The former displays only resources
that are in-spawn and filters resources versus inventory;
and the latter displays best matching resources, schematics
browsed one by one. This viewer is a mix of the two, quick,
and light weight.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
Resource and schematics data are chiefly obtained from
<b>SWGCraft.org</b>.
When you find anything to add, complement, or correct,
post a message at <nobr><font color="blue">
http://www.swgcraft.org/forums/</font></nobr> &mdash;
the better support we provide the better quality.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
In SWGAide, often a mouse right-click at a GUI element
displays a popup dialog with various options and features. 
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Notice 1</b>
&ndash; this viewer can be kept open and when you select
other resources it updates accordingly. If you switch main
window you must "re-open" this viewer at the new window.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Notice 2</b>
&ndash; neither the list of schematics nor competing
resources display creature resources if the schematics call
for Organic; it is easier to harvest Flora than to hunt and
harvest bazillions of creatures for the same crop.
</font></p>

Schematics Table
</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
Select and right-click a resource at one of those panels
that are using this viewer, select "Schematics Viewer".
The left-hand table displays the quality of the resource
for all schematics that can use it, but only if the quality
of the resource is better than Great, Good, or Fair.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
In this context "can use" means that the resource fits one
or several resource slots of the listed schematics, either
its resource class is called for by name or it is a proper
sub-class. The quality rates are based on the resource
classes that the schematics call for.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
For LQ schematics the resource class of the resource does
match a resource class called for by the listed schematics.
These schematics are displayed at a light cyan color and
they have no quality rating.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
Schematics are ordered/sorted in this way:<br/>
&ndash;
grouped by resource classes that pertain to the schematic,
from specific to more generic
<br/>
&ndash;
within a group, by quality rate of the resource versus the
schematic.
<br/>
To easily determine the groups of resource classes they are
displayed at a colored background: white denotes schematics
that call for a resource class that equals the resource you
selected; blue shades denote more generic resource classes
that the schematics call for, the darker the shade the more
generic. The background of the Rate column is determined by
the quality rate using the limits and colors you define at
Current Resources &rArr; Display Options.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
If the resource can be used in several resource slots of
a schematic the quality rate is based on the best matching
resource slot. For example, if the specified resource is a
Codoan Copper and a listed schematic is "SG82 Rifle" then
it is the resource slot for Codoan Copper that gives the
rate for the rifle, not the slot for Non-Ferrous Metal.
This is because caps for SR is 539 for Codoan but 900 for
Non-Ferrous, with an accordingly bad result for that slot.

<b>Schematics Table &mdash; Options and Popup menu: </b>
</font></p>

<blockquote>
<font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Min Rate </b>
&ndash; set the minimum limit for the quality rate of the
resource versus a schematic; select either Great, Good, or
Fair &mdash; the default limit is Great. Values and colors
for Fair/Good/Great are adjusted at Current Resources
&rArr; Display Options.
</font>

<blockquote>
<font face="Arial" size="-1">
Notice that the rate is for the resource on its own and it
should just be understood just as a hint. The rate <b><i>is
not </i></b> what is known as Weighed Average Rate (WAR)
&mdash; the difference is detailed in the <i>Beginner's
Guide for Traders</i>, chapter "Power Crafting".

</blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>LQ </b>
&ndash; include LQ schematics that call for a
<i>named resource class </i> when it matches the particular
resource. These schematics are listed at cyan background
and they have no quality rating.

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Select schematic</b>
&ndash; use this option to select a particular schematic
at the Schematics panels so it displays when you browse to
these panels.

Table of Competing Resources
</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
Select a schematic and the right-hand table populates with
resources that compete with the original resource, if any.
Just above the table is displayed the experimental property
that pertains to the rate for the resources: resource class
and weights for stats.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
The resources are either in-spawn or from your resource
inventory. Inventory-resources on tinted background and the
original resource in bold. All of these resources are rated
better than Min Rate and sort order is determined by their
quality versus the selected schematic.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
If only one schematic is displayed the table of competing
resources is populated automatically; this is also true if
all listed schematics call for the same resource class and
use the very same stats and weights.
