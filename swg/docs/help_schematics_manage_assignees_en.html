Help: Schematics &mdash; Manage Assignees and Favorites
</b></font></p>

<br/>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
This dialog provides the options to define and delete assignees,
and to add and remove favorite schematics from the assignees.
The dialog contains a number of elements for this and their use
is explained below. However, first a quick review of assignees
and the list of favorite schematic, and also a reminder that
this dialog <i>is not </i> about schematics inventory.
</font></p>

<blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>An assignee</b> is a place holder, an alias, a name for 
whatever purpose. At the resource section you define one or 
several assignees for resource inventory. For schematics you
define one or several assignees for one or several lists of
favorite schematics, and soon also for schematics inventory.
There is no requirement to define several assignees, it all
depends on your wish for a finer granularity for the lists
you create: several small lists or one or a few large lists.
</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
A schematics assignee can have one list of favorite schematics.
You either want to create an assignee with a large list for 
one profession, let us say Weaponsmith, or you break it down 
with an assignee for all weapon schematics and another assignee
for all quality components. Would you think that you need an 
even finer granularity, yeah, why not?
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
The other way around, a schematic can be listed for several
assignees and one assignee does not know of the other.
</font></p>

<p><hr align="center" width="50%"/></p><br/>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Schematics </b>and<b> Profession: </b><br/>
The left-hand list displays all schematics in SWG. To filter 
the list, select a profession at the drop-down list at the 
top of the middle section of the dialog.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Favorites: </b><br/>
The right-hand list displays all favorite schematics for a
selected assignee. 
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Assignees: </b><br/>
The center list displays all assignees. Select an assignee
to list its favorite schematics, or to add to or remove from
the list of favorites, or to delete or rename the assignee.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Define an assignee:</b><br/>
There are two ways to define an assignee: <br/>
&mdash; at this dialog, at the text field at the bottom of the
middle section, enter a unique name or text, and hit Enter at
the keyboard, <br/>
&mdash; at the Draft Schematics panel, select and right-click
at a schematic and select "Add to favorite..." and define a 
new assignee or select an existing at the small dialog. For 
more information, see the help text for the Draft Schematics 
panel.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Remove an assignee: </b><br/>
Select an assignee at the dialog's middle list, right-click
it for a popup dialog, select the option "Delete assignee...",
and confirm. If the assignee has some content, for example
favorite schematics, you are prompted with special warning 
dialogs.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Rename an assignee: </b><br/>
The popup dialog just mentioned also has an option to rename 
an assignee. Just enter a unique text or name and continue.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Add / Remove: </b><br/>
These buttons allow you to add and remove schematics to and
from the favorite list for the selected assignee. Or simply 
double-click a schematic to add it to the favorites, or 
double-click a favorite to remove it. 
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
Remember, you can easily browse and add to favorites at the
Draft Schematics panel, either one by one or those that are
contained under a category. 
</font></p>
