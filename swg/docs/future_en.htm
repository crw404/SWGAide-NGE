Now and Future
</b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
For SWGAide there are several plans, ideas, and suggestions
for new features and additions aimed at different aspects of
the game. Still your feedback and great ideas or suggestions
are welcomed. These will be added feature by feature, so stay
tuned.

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Developers</b>
&ndash; SWGAide is open source hosted at SourceForge.org and
Java developers are welcomed. Code submissions contributions
may be ready made implementations that are added as tabs at
an appropriate location. However, also smaller modules or
chunks of some kind of code is great, or even suggestions,
code reviews, unit tests, refactoring of some kind, etc.
</p></font>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Non-Developers</b>
&ndash; there are lots of data and you are welcomed to submit
useful data such as weapon stats, expertise trees, etc., etc.,
any format or style is fine. Post the input at SWGCraft.org
so the more players can benefit from the data and you 
automatically grant full credits to yourself ;)
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
Remember, the purpose of this utility is to enhance and make
our journey in SWG a pleasant and fun experience. Any feature
or addition which adds to that goal is welcomed.
