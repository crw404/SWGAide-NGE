<p><font face="Arial"><b>
Welcome to SWGAide! 
</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
SWGAide presents you with features focused around SWG, for
example a mail reader, a screen shot viewer, and many, many
tools for Traders, at the panels for Trade, Resource and
Schematics with their sub-features. 
</font></p>

<blockquote>
<font face="Arial" size="-1">
Vocabulary for the different help texts:
</font>

<blockquote>
<font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Current character </b>
&ndash;
the character who is selected at the <i>Main </i> panel.
<br/>
<b>Current galaxy </b>
&ndash;
the home galaxy for the <i>current character</i>.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
Most options and features are intuitive, I hope; 
however, here are some hints...
</font></p>

<blockquote>
<font face="Arial" size="-1">
&ndash;
hover the mouse cursor over an element to display its
fly-over text.
<br/>
&ndash;
often a mouse right-click at a GUI element
displays a popup dialog with various options and features. 
<br/>
&ndash;
you can safely play around with most features and options,
normally you must accept at a confirmation dialog.
<br/>
&ndash;
most panels have individual help texts,
click<b> F1 </b>at the keyboard.
<br/>
&ndash;
many panels, but not all, are reset by the keyboard shortcut
<b>Alt-C</b>.
<br/>
&ndash;
most text fields support keyboard shortcuts Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V,
and Ctrl-X for copy, paste, and cut, respectively.

<p><font face="Arial"><b>
The Main Panel
</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Universe Tree: </b><br/>
To the left hand side is displayed a tree of stations
(accounts), galaxies, characters, aliases, macros, notes,
and more. Select a character to view its in-game mails,
or select a file to open its editor/viewer.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
Notice: if SWGAide cannot find an installation of SWG, or
if you cancel the dialog to find SWG, some features are
temporarily disabled and affected GUI elements are tinted
red. When you install SWGAide a valid installation of SWG
is required, this is not negotiable.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
Notice: you may see stations, galaxies, or characters that
you no longer play, perhaps you also have deleted them from
SWG. These are displayed because they have left some foot
print at the hard disk, that is files or folders within the
StarWarsGalaxies\profiles folder. If you want to get rid of
them, you either... <br/>
&ndash;
delete or move them away from your hard disk,
use for example Window's File Explorer, or ... <br/>
&ndash;
right-click them one by one and select <b>Hide</b>.
</font></p>

<blockquote>
<font face="Arial" size="-1">
Hidden nodes are made invisible in SWGAide. At the menu
<b>Edit </b>&rArr;<b> Unhide</b> your restore all hidden
nodes. 
</font></blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial"><b>
Email Reader
</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
First of all you must save in-game mails to your hard disk
by the in-game command</font><font color="#0000ff"><tt>
/mailsave </tt></font><font face="Arial" size="-1">so that
SWGAide can find and display them. Once mails are saved to
disk you can delete them from your in-game mail client.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
SWGAide <i>does not </i> move mails from the<tt>
StarWarsGalaxies\profiles\ </tt>folder to its own "mails"
folder. See further down on how to improve mail handling.
</font></p>

<blockquote>
<font face="Arial" size="-1">
If<tt> /mailsave </tt>never complete with a system message,
then one or several mails are corrupt at the SWG servers.
To resolve this you either... <br/>
&ndash;
execute the in-game
command</font><font color="#0000ff"><tt> /emptyMail 
</tt></font><font face="Arial" size="-1">which deletes all
mails, or...
<br/>
&ndash;
in-game, select one mail after the
other, starting with the oldest. If the mail body does not
show up within reasonable time, you'd better delete that
mail. Rinse and repeat until it works.
</font>
</blockquote>

<font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Email Folders</b> &mdash;
SWGAide automatically sorts mails into different folders.
</font>
<blockquote>
<font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Inbox</b>
&ndash;
all mails that are not sorted into any other folder.
<br/>
<b>Sent</b>
&ndash;
mails that the character sent to self; remember to add
yourself at the TO-field, use ; to separate several names.
<br/>
<b>Auction</b>
&ndash;
auction and vendor mails.
<br/>
<b>Trash</b>
&ndash;
mails that you delete from other folders are moved to here.
</font>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>ISDroids</b>
&ndash;
reports sent from Interplanetary Survey Droids, this folder
exists in two fashions, the standard folder and mails look,
and a special panel with reporting features. Select the
<b>ISDroidPanel</b> check-box and SWGAide displays a panel
with options to smoothly submit resource data from ISDroid
reports to <font color="blue">SWGCraft.org</font>;
this panel has its own help text.
</font>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
You may create, rename, and delete custom mail folders;
perhaps you want to move all guild mails to one folder.

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Tips:</b>
If you play SWG at several computers, or if you want to use
SWGAide wherever, you can have SWGAide at a memory stick or
at a local network*. Then it is convenient to <i>copy mails
</i> into SWGAide's "mails" folder for availability always,
otherwise you just see mails you /mailsaved at the current
computer (* at a local network, SWGAide does not support
several instances to use the same DAT file in parallel).
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
The option to delete copied mails from SWG does not affect
SWGAide much. However, if you have thousands of old mails
at the hard disk it decreases performance, this depends on
your computer's file and disk handling.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b>
Aliases, Macros, &amp; Notes
</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
Select a file at the <i>Universe Tree </i> to display it
in an editor or viewer.
</font></p>

<blockquote>
<font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Aliases files</b> and <b>macros</b> cannot be edited;
perhaps this will change in the future.
</font>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Notes files</b> opens in an editor; text is modified and
saved as in a common text editor. Notes files are useful to
mediate information between SWGAide and in-game.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
In SWG, open the note-pad by the
command</font><font color="#0000ff"><tt> 
/note </tt></font><font face="Arial" size="-1">which opens
the default file "notes.txt". Open a custom notes file by
the command</font><font color="#0000ff"><tt> 
/note myfile</tt></font><font face="Arial" size="-1">. This
opens the file "myfile.txt" and if it does not exists it is
created. Notes files that are created, edited, erased, or
saved in SWGAide are instantly visible in SWG when you open
the file again.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Notice</b>
&ndash;
you <i>must not </i> type "myfile.txt", with a file suffix.
SWG adds another .txt and the result is a file named
"myfile.txt.txt".
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Attention</b> &ndash; you cannot have a notes file open
in SWG and edit-and-save the very same file in SWGAide. Any
changes are overwritten by SWG when you later close the
in-game notepad. Thus, always close the in-game notepad
when you switch to SWGAide to edit the file.
</font></p>

<br/><br/>

<p><font face="Arial"><b>
Album &mdash; Screen Shot Viewer
</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
SWGAide presents you with a basic screen shot viewer that
displays in-game screenshots. Select SWG or TC and SWGAide
displays thumb nails respectively. Select a thumb nail to
display the image in full or in scaled down size.
</font></p>

<blockquote>
<font face="Arial" size="-1">
A popup dialog provides you with options to add, rename, or
delete custom folders, to save or delete images, and more.
