<b>Help - Submit Resources </b>
</font></p>

<br/><br/>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
This section of SWGAide presents you with a feature
to easily submit a single resource, or to submit several
resources in a semiautomated fashion which useful for the
players who manually update SWGCraft.org with for example
creature resources. No copy & paste, just a few mouse clicks
plus editing an in-game notes file.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
With the feature for multi-submit you can write a set of
resources to an in-game notes file named "rem.txt". Then, in
game, you look them up with for example a 30k resource crate
to see if there is any action required, see further down. The
output <i>always includes </i> stat-less resources, no matter
their age but possibly filtered on resource class or planet.
</font></p>

<br/>

<blockquote>
<font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Mandatory resource classes </b>
&mdash; these are resource classes that are always in spawn
in SWG; each of these classes always has one and only one
resource in spawn; they are: <br/>
&ndash; all of Organic <br/>
&ndash; all Fiberplast <br/>
&ndash; all JTL<br/>
Organic and Fiberplast are also planetary and SWGAide
automatically selects the correct planet. When you submit
mandatory resources to SWGCraft the older counterparts are
automatically marked as unavailable. 
</font>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
For the resource class or planet that is filtered for,
if mandatory resources are missing at SWGCraft.org they are
always written to the notes file.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
Summary: the resource-class/planet and the age filters
allow you to focus on a small, manageable set of resources
and only if you find that a resource is new, replaced, or 
depleted you need take action.
&mdash; This text is referred to later in this document.
</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial">
<b>Single input / Edit </b>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
The upper panel has two distinct functions: <br/>
1 &mdash; <b>submit</b> a single resource to SWGCraft.org
<br/>
2 &mdash; <b>edit</b> an entry that is selected at the list
of multiple resources; assuming that you have loaded a notes
file.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
The input fields for <b>planets</b> and for <b>resource
class</b> support <b>abbreviated input</b> and the result
is displayed just under the input fields.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Resource names</b> requires you to be careful, a spelling
error will block a future submission to SWGCraft.org for that
name ... until it is corrected by the moderators.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Stats</b> are optional, you can submit a resource without
stats and complement the resource later on; it is better to
submit without stats than not or several hours later. Type
only the stats which are displayed in-game and in the same
order as you read them. When a resource class is selected
the expected stats are displayed under the input field.
Errors are displayed in red above the input fields, usual
errors are: values outside the caps for the resource class,
too few or too many values, or input that is not a number.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
Once resource data are entered and no error is displayed,
click <b>Submit</b> to upload the single resource to
SWGCraft.org; see a later paragraph on similar names.<br />
If you rather are <u>editing</u> an entry that you selected
at the list of multiple resources this button is named
<b>Apply</b>.
</font></p>

<br/>

<p><font face="Arial">
<b>Multiple resources </b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
The center and bottom section of this panel are used for
submitting a batch of several resources. For this feature
you create an in-game notes file named "rem.txt" which you
update in-game. First a walk-through:
</font></p>

<br/>

<p><font face="Arial">
<b>1 &mdash; Prepare the notes file </b>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
a &ndash; <b>Filter on</b> resource class, planet, or
stat-less to narrow down the set of resources to handle.
The stat-less filter writes all resources that are listed at
SWGCraft.org without stats.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
b &ndash; <b>Limit on age</b> to narrow the set even more.
Default age is 6 days which is the minimum lifetime for all
resources in SWG, except that JTL resources are 13 days.
Default is fine for all mandatory resources but for all other
classes you may want to use 0 days to be able to see what is
reported and what is not.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
c &ndash; <b>Write to "rem.txt"</b> for in-game editing. If
the notes file is not empty a dialog displays with the options
to Erase, Append, or Cancel. The option to Append makes it
possible to apply one filter after the other and append to
the file. Resources are written to the file in the same order
as their resource classes are listed in the 30k resource
crate to make it the easier to look them up.
</font></p>
 
<br/>

<p><font face="Arial">
<b>2 &mdash; In-game, edit the notes file </b>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
This far you have a notes file that is named "rem.txt".
The file contains current, missing, and so called stat-less
resources; they have three different looks:</font>
<pre>
     Resourcename , Resource Class, (age, nbr of days)
     Resourcename , Resource Class, add-stats
      , Resource Class, 
</pre>
</p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
&mdash; the first look is for current resources and it reads
their age; find out if they are replaced <br />
&mdash; the second look is for resources which are reported
without stats; add stats if you can <br/> 
&mdash; the third look is for mandatory resources where none
is listed at SWGCraft; add the resource if you can
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
a &mdash; <b>Open</b> the notes file with the command
</font><font color="blue"><tt>/notes rem
</tt></font><font face="Arial" size="-1">&mdash;
notice that you must not type the file suffix ".txt",
otherwise you creates a file named "rem.txt.txt".
The header of the notes file reads today's date and a brief
help text, do not edit this header.
These are the possible actions:
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
b &mdash; <b>Verify</b> that the header of the notes file
reads today's date. If you need it also reads a brief help
text. Do not edit this header.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
c &mdash; <b>Edit</b> the notes file; while looking up the
resources you will find that these are the possible actions
(lookup is easiest via a 30k resource crate):

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
For your convenience SWGAide supports the delimiters<tt>
" .,:;" </tt>(quotes excluded) but between name and resource
 class you <b><i>must use </i></b> a comma sign.

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
d &mdash; <b>Close</b> the in-game notes editor so that the
file is saved to disk. If you leave the editor open and read
or edit it outside SWG the outcome is undefined and the data
is lost or corrupt.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
Remember that SWGAide supports abbreviated input for planet
names and resource classes, that planets of planetary resources
are automatically handled, and that resource names are properly
capitalized by SWGAide.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Examples</b> of valid input lines:</font
<pre>
    Corellia Rori Yavin, Amaraz, Lubricating Oil, 789 963
    c, r, y, amaraz, lu oil, 789 963
    Evilsoup, dat wa, 987 456
    evilSOUP, dat wa, 987     456
    depl, Restinpeace, Colat Iron, 9
    depl, restinpeace
</pre>
</p>

<font face="Arial" size="-1">
The first two entries equal each other in spite of the
abbreviations of the second. The third entry is a Dathomir
Water Vapor which is planetary, hence the planet may be
omitted; notice that upper or lower case is corrected by
SWGAide. The last entries are for a depleted resource, the
word "depl, " is prepended to the entry and anything after
the resource name is ignored; tips: if possible, re-use the
resource class for a new resource.

<blockquote><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Similar resource names &mdash; Dialog</b>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
To avoid that you submit resources that double those that
already are listed at SWGCraft.org SWGAide determines how
similar the names of your resources are with all other
resources. Equal names are already handled but a spelling
error is so easily done, either by you or another player.
If such names are found SWGAide displays a dialog with some
options.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
If a resource is similar to many other resources you see a
<b>cluster</b> of your resource and those it mimics. Then
<i>review all </i> alerts in that cluster before you decide
how to proceed. 
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
Both single and clustered resources have two buttons per
entry, to send your resource or send a name correction, and
you can of course decide to do nothing.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Submit new</b>
&mdash; press this button to send your resource as is;
this is when when SWGAide displays a false alert, your
resource and the other resource are not the same ... see
below. If your resource is in a cluster, review all alerts
before you decide how to proceed.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Submit name</b>
&mdash; press this button to edit the name of the older
resource to the name of your resource; this is when the
older resource is correct except for its name - both your
and the older resource must be identical except for the
names. If the opposite is true, your resource is wrong and
the existing is correct, do nothing. If your resource is in
a cluster, review all alerts before you decide how to
proceed.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
Other error types are not handled by this dialog. To edit
the stats of a resource you just send it with the correct
values and this dialog is never used (assuming that the
name is correct).
If the resource class is in error, currently SWGAide does
not support this edit but you must visit SWGCraft.
If planets are in error, this must always be reported at
the resource forum at SWGCraft.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>False alarms</b>
&mdash; the algorithm to determine if names are similar
is called the Levenshtein distance; it is quite simple and
measures how many edits it takes to change one name to the
other, the edits being replace, add, or erase. Thus, it is
a fair risk for false alarms every now and then, certainly
so for the shorter names. Should SWGAide really test name
similarities also against other resource classes?
Maybe, maybe not; please report your experience so that we
can improve the logic.
</font></p>
</blockquote>

<br/><br/>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Tips: </b><br/>
Use the <b>30k resource deed</b> which is a 6 months veteran
reward. Per resource class the most recent resource is listed
bottommost, which makes it easy to determine if it is a new
name or not (rarely the crate displays the name topmost, but
just for the session; a bug of some kind). Select a resource
and the crate reads its stats at the next screen. After this
screen it comes a confirmation screen, hence, those scary
moments of the past, while reading the stats, are history.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
The resources are written to the in-game notes file in the
same order as resource classes are listed in the 30k deed,
credits to Rommel. This makes it most convenient to lookup
resources while walking through the notes file.
</font></p>

<br/>

<p><font face="Arial">
<b>Misc: </b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
a &mdash; 
This panel supports a black-list for resource classes you
never want to manage. In the folder <SWGAide>\misc you create
a file which must be named "submit_blacklist.txt". Specify
resource classes, each at a line by itself, for example:
</font>
<pre>
    Seafood
    Horn
    Egg
</pre>
</p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
b &mdash;
Another option; if you want to manage resources which are
not possible to harvest naturally then right click the main
panel and select "Allow non-harvestable". These resources
can only be obtained by popping a 30k resource crate.
</font></p>
