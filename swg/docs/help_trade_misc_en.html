<b>Help: Trade - Misc Panel </b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
The general help for the trade section is available while browsing the other 
tabs under the "Trade" tab. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
The mapping "price to item name" is a special treat for the advanced Trader. 
</font></p>

<UL>
<li><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Add: </b>Select the bottommost empty cells with a "price" and a fancy item 
name. </font>
</li>
<li><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Edit: </b>Click a cell and edit the content. </font>
</li>
<li><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Delete: </b>Select a line and press Delete at the keyboard or at the menu 
Edit. </font>
</li>
</UL>

<font face="Arial" size="-1">
The table expands itself for each new price/name pair you add to it. </font>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
The table auto-saves when you switch character and when the application exits, 
or you can use Save at the menu File, or Ctrl-S. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
Only "<u>blank</u>" item names are affected and then only for display. For any 
blank name SWGAide tries to look up a mapping and if a name is found for the 
"price" it is displayed in blue color. SWGAide looks at the <U>three rightmost 
digits</U> of the price and tries to find an item name mapped for those digits. 
Hence, "23" is really read as "023" and does not equal "123". Similarly the 
price "1234" also equals "9234" as the three rightmost digits are equal, 
namely "234". </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Shared mapping: </b>Deselect this option to have individual mappings for each
Trader, or for some Traders. However, many players probably prefer just one set
of mappings for all their Traders. The option is per character, perhaps you want
to have only one or a few Traders using individual mappings while others share 
a global mapping.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
NOTE: if you make a character go from individual mapping to "Shared mapping" 
the individual mappings are preserved by adding them to the global mapping. 
Thus, you may want to edit the mappings before the change. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<u>Tip</u>: Begin with creating the shared mappings, but only them, and save. 
Now deselect the option "Shared mapping" for the Traders you want to treat 
individually, add the special price/item-name pairs for them, and save. 
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Map always: </b>Make existing price/name pairs overrule names also for items
<I>with</I> names. This is useful, for example, while selling items such as "An 
incubated egg" (a static name) but you want to know which of several eggs that 
was sold, or any other item with equal names but different stats. Simply price 
them differently. This option is global for all Traders, on or off. 
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Background: </b>Many players prefer to have blank names on items for 
furnishing, not to clutter their home with a lot of text. To meet their needs 
you name the items with a couple of blank spaces. This is no problem as long as 
you only do this for special orders, right? </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
Some Traders have made it their business niche to provide blank named items. But
then, from the auction mails how do they know what is sold and what not when the 
mails do not read the item names? However, clever players begun to price their 
items in a way that they know what item is sold; they manually maintained a 
piece of paper with prices mapped to item names. This special treat saves them
the hassle. </font></p>
