<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
This panel presents you with the means to review and
select the best matching resources for a selected schematic. 
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
Schematic data are obtained from
<nobr><b>www.SWGCraft.org</b></nobr>, information that is
submitted and updated by players like you and me.
</font></p>

<blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
When &mdash; not if but when &mdash; you find anything to add,
complement, or correct, post it in <nobr><font color="blue">
http://www.swgcraft.org/forums/viewforum.php?f=18</font></nobr>.
Or add a note to the comment field at the schematic's web page
at SWGCraft. Or, even better, post an application to become a 
<i>schematics maintainer </i> to help the community in SWG. 
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
The more players that update SWGCraft about new resources the
better this panel can support your crafting; find the ISDroid
folder at the mail section and the "Submit Resources" which is
for submission of one or several resource data. 
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
In SWGAide, often a mouse right-click at a GUI element displays
a popup dialog with various options and features. 
</font></p>
</blockquote>

<br/>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Manage Assignee and Favorites </b><br/>
At a special dialog you manage assignees and their lists of
favorite schematics. Open the dialog at the <b>Edit</b> menu,
and at relevant popup menus, then click F1 for a more detailed
text about assignees and favorite lists. Briefly though, each
assignee has its list of favorites, create several assignees
for multiple favorite lists. These lists are used in several
filters, often to limit the display, but more features will
be added over time.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Test Bench </b><br/>
At a special dialog you can test which resources that make
for the best result. Double click a schematic at the upper
left list, then click F1 for a more detailed help text.
Briefly though, fill a schematic's resource slots and the
dialog displays how well each resource makes it for the
required stats and for different experimental lines, and
it displays the total result. Replace resources and compare
the total result.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">
<b>The Laboratory </b>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
This panel displays the best matching resources, those that
currently are spawning or those from the Resource Inventory.
Features for stocked items (todo), notes,
and more is also found at this panel, whereof some is coming
soon&trade;.

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Assignees: </b><br/>
Select an assignee to display its favorite schematics at
the below list of schematics, or select "All"; this is at
the upper-left drop-down list. To manage assignees, see a
paragraph above.

<b>Select schematic</b>
&ndash; select a schematic and use this option to select the
current schematic at other GUI panels as a convenience. This
overrides but does not modify possible filters that would
hinder the display. If <i>Always select </i> at the Options
menu is enabled there is no need to invoke this option.

schematics for the selected assignee, default is "All".
This option is for the current session and it affects only
the list of schematics. Notice that as
LQ counts any schematic that is tagged as LQ or is without
experimenting properties, otherwise, if its quality level
is HQ, mixed, or unknown it counts as HQ.

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Item Inventory: </b><br/>
The center element displays the inventory for the selected
schematic (TODO). An entry contains information on inventory
balance and also which resources and which components that
were used to craft them &ndash; the information that is read
at a manufacture schematic. The first entry at this
table is always the <b><i>default schematic</i></b>, a common
entry point while browsing for resources and future stuff. 
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
Select an entry to update the notes field and the resource
table; the default schematic updates the resource table with
the best matching resources, see below for further details;
any other entry (todo) updates the resources table with the
resources which were used to craft the entry.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Notes field: </b><br>
Select an entry at the center element to update this field,
or to enter custom notes for the selected entry. Notes are
per assignee and entry, not just per schematic. This means
that if a particular schematic is a favorite for several
assignees the notes are individual per assignee; "All" is
considered a generic assignee. Remember to save the note,
see below.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Notes field &mdash; Popup menu: </b>
</font></p>

<blockquote>
<font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Save notes </b>

this <b><i>is required</i></b>, otherwise the new or edited
text is discarded. You can also press Ctrl-S.

<p><font face="Arial">
<b>Table of Experiments and Matching Resources </b>
</font></p>  

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
Select a <b><i>default schematic </i></b> and the table for
experiments and resources is updated and displays the best
matching resources. Select an <b><i>inventory item </i></b>
(todo)
and the table rather displays the resources which
were used to craft the item.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<i>Best matching resources</i>
&mdash; these are resources that fit the resource slot in
the schematic, their resource class fulfills the request.
Here follows an explanation of this special table:
</font></p>  

<blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>High quality </b>
&mdash; for schematics that require <b>high quality</b>
resources the table displays the best possible match. For
the details on the math behind the curtains, see
chapter "Power Crafting" in the <i>Beginner's Guide for
Traders</i> at SWGCraft.org, the General crafting forum.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Low quality </b>
&mdash; for schematics that can use <b>low quality</b>
resources the table displays the worst possible rate. In
this case the quality of the resource classes in themselves
determines the rate, neither the stats nor the particular
resource class which the schematic calls for. This is an
attempt not to suggest high-quality resources.
</font></p>

<br/>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Merged experiments: </b><br/>
For every experimentation line that equals another line the
two or more are merged to one item. This happens if the lines
call for <i>the same resource class </i> and <i>identical 
weights</i>.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Example: </b>
the BM schematic "Enzyme Centrifuge Separation Filter" calls
for "Fiberplast" and it has two experimentation lines, one
line for "Purity" and one for "Mutagen Potential". However,
both lines use "DR/OQ 20/80" and thus they are merged into
one group. The merge is made visible in the group's name, in
this case "Fiberplast DR/OQ 20/80 Enzyme Purity, Mutagen".
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
The merges result in one group per different resource class
and per different weights. Most schematics have only a few
combinations, just a few schematics result in a larger amount
of merged groups.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
However, low quality schematics display just one group per
required resource class. They do not have experimentation
properties and thus only the classes are displayed.
</font></p>

<br/>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Inventory Resources: </b><br/>
Resources from your inventory read their names and resource
classes at the "fair" background color in the same manner
that is used at the Current Resources panel. Hover the mouse
over the table row and the fly-over text displays the total
amount in stock; this is also displayed in the <b>Amount</b>
column.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Superior Resources: </b><br/>
Resources that are better than your current stock read their
names and resource classes at the "great" color background
to make them stand out as an alert. This color alert is not
applied to low quality schematics. Hover the mouse over the
table row and the fly-over text displays the age.
</font></p>

<br/>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Coloring: </b><br/>
The value of a resource stat is colored in the same manner
as at the Resources section, its background is tinted with
the colors for the "fair", "good", and "great" quality.
Adjust the colors and the limits for the coloring at
Current Resources &rarr; Display Options. 
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
For <b>high quality</b> schematics the the quality and color
is determined relative the caps of the resource class for the
merged group. Stats that are required by the experimentation
line are rendered in bold.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
For <b>low quality</b> schematics the colors are determined
relative the resource itself, as how default coloring works
at Current Resources and Inventory. This is to highlight
that a resource might be great in itself,
in one way or another.
</font></p>

<br/>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Rate: </b><br/>
For <b>high quality</b> schematics a "rate" is computed by
the experimentation weights of the current group. A rate is
computed per resource and is not the "weighed average result".
At this section SWGAide always uses the "<i>rule of
thumb</i>"; any resource that lacks one or or more of the
required stats but yet have a good enough rating is listed.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
For <b>low quality</b> schematics the "rate" is an <i>average
quality </i> per resource, computed over all non-zero values,
each value relative the cap for its own resource class, not
the class that the merged group calls for.
</font></p>

<br/>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Empty Group: </b><br/>
If no resource is available for a merged group it is left
empty, it just reads its title, weights and resource class.
</font></p>

<br/>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
Double-click a resource at this table to open the <b>Test
Bench</b> dialog and/or to fill its slots; it has its own
help text.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Table of Experiments and Matching Resources 
&mdash; Popup dialog: </b></p>

<blockquote>
<font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Resource details...</b> 
&ndash: displays a dialog with details about the selected
resource. The dialog reads details about planets and age,
and if the resource is already in inventory also its notes
and total amount.
</font>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Select current</b> 
&ndash; if the selected resource is in spawn then this option
selects it at the table of current resources as a convenience.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Filter current </b>
&ndash; filters table of currently spawning resources for
the resource class that the schematic calls for and
highlights a selected resource.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Filter inventory </b> 
&ndash; filters the resource inventory and sorts it for
the filter that pertains to the selected entry, the class
of a selected resource, or a class of the group. For the
latter, select the header line of the group.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Quality guard... </b>
&ndash; opens the usual dialog for creating resource guards
and with some values pre-filled. In this case the dialog is
setup for the resource class of the group, no matter if a
resource or a header line is selected. This option is disabled
if a matching guard exist or if the schematics is low-quality.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Plain guard... </b>
&ndash; creates a plain guard that alerts whenever the
specified resource class spawns. The new guard is named "Any
spawn" and it is set to OQ = 1 &ndash; such a guard alerts
whenever the resource class spawns, no matter the quality.
This option is disabled if a matching guard exist or if the
schematics is high-quality.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Resource amount... </b>
&ndash; adjust the maximum amount of resources to display
at the main table; the range is from 3 to 10 resources. The
table displays as many resources as possible but never more
than 5 or the value you select.
</font></p>
</blockquote>

<br/>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<i>Limitations: </i>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
Currently just 5 resources per group are displayed.
Soon&trade; more options will be available in SWGAide to
fine-tune what to display and what not.
</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Future: </b><br/>
If you have read this far I think it is fair to tell that
there are lots of minor and major items at the todo-list.
Some are mentioned already but more are planned for. If
there is anything in particular you wish for, use the forum
thread http://www.swgcraft.org/forums/viewforum.php?f=43
</font></p>
 
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
The immediate items are to fix several glitches, and to add
those options that are essential for making this section of
SWGAide to excel. Adding a panel for improved resource guards,
adding Inventory for crafted items, wiring such an inventory
between schematics and required components, wiring such an
inventory with the Trade section (probably that section
needs some love first), and more.
