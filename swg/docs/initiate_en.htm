Initiating SWGAide
</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
Initialization is done in a few steps; any previous data
is backed up to a file which is displayed at the log bar;
see the README file on how to restore a DAT file.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
If you use Windows 7 or Vista you must allow Java to execute
in "admin" mode, if you have not fixed that already you must
exit now and see the README file, a section about Windows.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Notice:</b> the following steps may take a few minutes,
just relax.
</font></p>

<ol>
<li><font face="Arial" size="-1">
Find and select the installation folder for
StarWarsGalaxies on your computer, usually it is similar to
<font color="blue">
C:\Program&nbsp;Files&nbsp;(x86)\StarWarsGalaxies</font>,
but you may have another setup.
</font> 

<br/> <br/>

</li>
<li><font face="Arial" size="-1">
SWGAide builds a graphical view of your stations (accounts),
galaxies, and characters that are found at your computer.
</font> 
</li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
Once SWGAide is installed, always remember that
<b>&nbsp;F1&nbsp;</b> always takes you to the help text for
the current panel.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
Many options and features are provided via popup menus that
are opened by a right-hand mouse click at a GUI element.
