Help &mdash; ISDroid Reports
</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
This panel presents you with features to manage reports
from <u>Interplanetary Survey Droids</u> (aka ISDroids)
and to upload resource data to SWGCraft.org. In summary,
SWGAide scans the ISDroid reports and compares them with
resources that are listed at SWGCraft.org and determines
which resources that are new or depleted, or if they can
be complemented with stats or planets. Then the result is
displayed at the GUI elements and you select appropriate
actions; first you submits depleted resources and planet
availability; second you write resources to a notes file
and in-game edit the file with stats; finally you submit
new and complemented resources to SWGCraft.org which also
makes it available in SWGAide.

<font face="Arial"><b>
Setup
</b></font>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>SWGCraft.org</b>
&ndash; to be able to submit resources to SWGCraft.org you
must register yourself at the site and you must let SWGAide
know user-name and password; open the SWGCraft dialog via
menu <b>Options &raquo; SWGCraft... </b>. SWGAide stores
the password in encrypted form in the DAT file and it is
never sent anywhere but only used when communicating with
SWGCraft, and also then it is strongly encrypted.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Options</b>
&ndash; at menu <b>Options &raquo; ISdroid</b> you specify
your preferences:
</font>

<ul>
<li><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Allow w/o stats</b>
&ndash; allow submission of new resources without stats,
this is recommended. Resources submitted without stats are
made visible for more players who can complement them at any
convenient date; conversely, not submitted resources cannot
be augmented and possibly they do not trigger depletion of
older resources (this is Organics).  
</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Long list</b>
&ndash; write to the notes file as one continuous list. The
list is ordered for convenient browsing of the "30k veteran
resource crate". Otherwise the output is "planetary", the
list is written planet by planet, this is for players who
hand sample for stats.
</font>
</li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Skip duplicates</b>
&ndash; do not double resources that are already written to
the notes file (only in "planetary" mode). Otherwise doubled
resources are marked with trailing stars (**); you add stats
just to one of the doubled resources.
</font>
</li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Auto-delete</b>
&ndash; allow SWGAide to automatically erase content of the
notes file after error-free submission to SWGCraft.org. If
there is an error the file is retained; a backup is always
created in the "backups" folder.
</font>
</li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Single report</b>
&ndash; select this option to manage ISDroid reports one by
one rather than all reports in one batch. Default is all in
one batch which also is safer and a lot faster.
</font>
</li>

<!--
<li><font face="Arial">
<b>GUI input: 
</b>Enable the GUI input feature, not yet implemented. </font>
</li>
-->

<li><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Help text</b>
&ndash; always append a help text to the notes file.
</font>
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<br/><br/>

<p><font face="Arial"><b>
Initializing the ISDroid panel
</b></font></p>

<font face="Arial" size="-1">
This panel populates itself when it is opened. However,
because ISDroid reports arrive as in-game mails you must
first have done
<font color="blue"><tt>/mailsave</tt></font> as for any
other mail. Then, when opening this panel, if a report is
older than 4 hours SWGAide displays a warning dialog with
the options:
</font>

<ul>
<li><font face="Arial" size="-1">
delete the report
</font>
</li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="-1">
delete <i>all</i> old reports
</font>
</li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="-1">
continue, which is OK if you know that the data is still
valid. In fact, a slightly aged report makes no harm, at
most a few new or a few depleted resources are omitted.
</font>
</li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
However, if you realize that you must refresh this panel,
first see limitation one further down.
</font></p>

<br/>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><b>
GUI Elements
</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
This panel displays four lists of resources that are up for
action and buttons for these actions. Lists 1 and 2 can be
submitted right away, without further ado. Lists 3 and 4
display resources that you are welcomed to update with
stats before submission (optional); you can also submit
them without stats right away.
</font></p>

<blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>List 1</b>
&ndash; resources which are already listed at SWGCraft.org
but your reports add one or several planets to them.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>List 2</b>
&ndash; resources which are depleted from the galaxy.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>List 3</b>
&ndash; new resources which are not yet reported to
SWGCraft.org.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>List 4</b>
&ndash; resources which are listed at SWGCraft.org without
stats; you are welcomed to complement them with stats.
</font></p>
</blockquote>

<br/>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Submit 1 & 2</b>
&ndash; press this button to submit everything displayed in
lists 1 and 2.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Write to "res.txt"</b>
&ndash; press this button to write the content of lists 3
and 4 to the "res.txt" notes file; select output style as
described above. If the notes file is not empty SWGAide
displays a dialog with the options to erase the content,
or to cancel; a backup is always created in "backups".
</font></p>

<blockquote><font face="Arial" size="-1">
&mdash; Before you press next button, switch to SWG to add
stats to the resources in the notes file; this is optional
and if you cannot complement the resources now it is better
to submit them right away without stats. This way you notify
others that these resources exist and you also records the
earliest possible date for their spawn. Otherwise these
resources are available but nobody knows about them and
the recorded spawn date is the worse.
</font></blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Submit "res.txt"</b> 
&ndash; </b>press this button to submit the data from lists
3 and 4 together with the stats you optionally have added
to the notes file. If there are errors in the notes file
SWGAide displays a dialog:
</font></p>

<blockquote>
<font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Errors</b> 
&ndash; when SWGAide reads the updated notes file, but
before submitting anything to SWGCraft, if there is an
error it is displayed at a GUI dialog with the options
to Abort, Edit the line, or Skip the line. If there are
several error this dialog is displayed for each of them,
unless you select Abort. 
</font>

<ul>
<li><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Abort</b>
&ndash; terminate the process so that you can manually
edit the "res.txt" notes file. Perhaps you can edit the
file at SWGAide's Main panel, or you may have to find some
data in SWG. Once you have corrected the error you press
the submit button once again. Use this option if an error
cannot be solved by the other options. 
</font>
</li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Edit now</b>
&ndash; open another dialog at which you can edit the line
right away, if that is possible. 
</font>
</li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Skip line</b>
&ndash; ignore whatever you wrote at this line and if it is
possible SWGAide submits the resource as-is. This usually
means that SWGAide submits the resource for all planets but
without stats. 
</font>
</li>
</ul>

<font face="Arial" size="-1">
A few other dialogs are possible, they are self-explaining.
</font></p>

<font face="Arial" size="-1">
After submission SWGAide sometimes displays another dialog
about similarly named resources, see further down.  
</font></p>
</blockquote>

<br/>

<font face="Arial" size="-1"><b>
"res.txt" notes file</b>
&ndash; the way it looks depends on the options described
above; this sample of a <b><i>planetary output </i></b>
covers the important parts:
</font>

<blockquote>
<pre>
Chimaera / Lok / 1234567890
swgcraft_start
Alpha,Desh Copper,
Beta,Colat Iron,
swgcraft_end

Chimaera / Tatooine / 1234567890

Sigma,Kelsh Copper,
Delta,Dolovite Iron,90,89,78,67,56,45,34,23
Alpha,Desh Copper,**
swgcraft_end</pre></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
Notice the two blocks of resources, one for each planet the
ISDroid reports pertain to. The first line reads the galaxy
and planet, plus a time stamp of the report. The block is
delimited by the lines "swgcraft_start" and "swgcraft_end",
you <u>must <b>not</b> edit these lines</u>. Such a block
contains just resources that should be complemented with
stats; each line read a name and a resource class. 
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
Notice in the second block, the last resource reads some
trailing ** after the resource class. Compare the blocks
and see that this Desh Copper was already listed, the stars
is just a reminder and doubles are always listed last. See
the option "skip duplicates".
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Long list</b>
&ndash; provides a similar list but it is sorted for ease
of use together with the "30k Veteran Resource Crate" and
SWGAide keeps track of the planets.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
SWGAide always keeps track of planets, this is true also
for the planetary style, hence you can manually delete
doubles if you want to. However, see limitations 2. 
</font></p>
</blockquote>

<br/><br/>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>In-game</b>
&ndash; within SWG you open a basic notepad by the
command<font color="blue"><b><tt> /note&nbsp;res
</tt></b></font>
&ndash; notice that you do not type the</font><tt>
.txt</tt><font face="Arial" size="-1">. For each resource,
append the stats at the end of the line in the same order
as stats are read in-game. As delimiter between stats, use
any of 
&nbsp;"</font><tt>,.;: </tt><font face="Arial" size="-1">"
(white space is OK but quotes are excluded).
Notice, for manual submission at SWGCraft only comma signs
and no white spaces whatsoever works as delimiters; see the
example above, the Dolovite Iron in the second block. 
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
You obtain resource stats either by hand sampling and read
their stats at the examine window. However, it is more
convenient to use a "30k Veteran Reward Resource Crate",
its correct name is "A&nbsp;crate of free resources". This
reward is indeed a <b><i>galaxy-wide sampling device</i></b>;
for each resource class, the most recent resource is almost
always listed bottommost. Select a resource and the next
window reads its stats; you back out with Cancel or the
Escape button of the keyboard; otherwise a confirm dialog
prevents you from the mishaps we had in the past.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
Once you are done in-game you must close the notepad which
also saves the notes file to disk so that SWGAide can read
your notes. Do not have this file open in-game while you
edit it elsewhere because your edits are overwritten by SWG
when you close the notepad.
</font></p>

<br/><br/>

<font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Similar resource names &mdash; Dialog</b>
</font></p>

<font face="Arial" size="-1">
After SWGAide has submitted resources to SWGCraft,
sometimes this dialog is displayed; this section explains
why, false alerts, and how to act:
</font>

<blockquote>
<font face="Arial" size="-1">
To prevent that you submit resources that double resources
that are already listed at SWGCraft.org SWGAide determines
how similar the names of your resources are with all other
resources. A <b>spelling error</b> is so easily done, this
is without competition the most common mistake, either by
you or another player. If such names are found SWGAide
displays a dialog with some options.
</font>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
Remember that ISDroids in themselves contain no spelling
errors, but if a resource is already submitted manually,
either via SWGAide or at SWGCraft, it may be in error. If
you then try to upload a report, with a correct name, you
are about to submit a double. 

<blockquote><b><i>
In this case you should not submit but correct the existing
entry.
</i></b></blockquote></font></p>

<br/>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
If a resource is <b>similar to several</b> other resources
you see a cluster of your resource and those with similar
names. Please, <i>review all </i> alerts in that cluster
before you decide how to proceed and select at most one of
the options. 
</font></p>

<font face="Arial" size="-1">
Each entry at the dialog has two buttons; to send your
resource, or to send a name correction, but you can of
course decide to do nothing.
</font>

<blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Submit new</b>
&mdash; press this button to send your resource as-is;
see "false alert" below. If your resource is in a cluster,
review all alerts before you decide how to proceed.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Submit name</b>
&mdash; press this button to send a name correction for the
existing resource; the other resource is correct except for
its name &mdash; both your and the older resource must be
identical except for the names. If your resource is in a
cluster, review all other alerts.
</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
Other errors are not handled by this dialog.
If the resource class is in error you must visit SWGCraft
to edit the class, or to report the error at the resource
forum. 
If planets are in error you must report that at the
resource forum at SWGCraft; only moderators can resolve
such errors
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>False alerts</b>
&mdash; the algorithm to determine if names are similar
is called the Levenshtein distance; it is quite simple and
measures how many edits it takes to change one name to the
other, the edits being replace, add, or erase. Thus, it is
a fair risk for false alerts every now and then, certainly
so for the shorter names. 
To prevent too many false alerts SWGAide also tests the
resource classes against each other, a quite simple test.
However, please report your experience so that we can
improve the logic.
</font></p>
</blockquote>

<br/><br/>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Black-list</b>
&ndash; to prevent unwanted clutter in the "res.txt" notes
file you can create a file named "isdroid_blacklist.txt" in
the "misc" folder. Type the resource class that you want to
hide, one class per line; you must spell exactly as the
classes are read elsewhere in SWGAide.
</font></p>

<br/><br/>

<font face="Arial" size="-1">
<font color="red"><b>
Limitation 1 
</b></font>
&mdash; the ISDroid panel retains its content as long as
you do not switch to another character to view its ISDroid
panel or as long as you do not exit SWGAide.
<br/>
<b>pros</b>: resource data is not compromised by some other
action and you can safely submit the content without further
verification.
<br/>
<b>cons</b>: new data from SWGCraft.org does not update the
content of the panel, neither does new ISDroid reports.
</font>

<blockquote>
<font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Force an update of this panel</b>
&ndash; switch to any other character and view its ISDroid
panel and then switch back. This resets all internal states
and refreshes all lists for ISDroid reports but it does not
overwrite the "res.txt" notes file.
</font>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
While you are updating the "res.txt" notes file you <u>do
not</u> want to switch to another character in SWGAide and
view the ISDroid panel. If you did, to be able to continue
must copy or save the content of the file somehow; then you
press "write to file" to generate an updated file. Notice,
the new output may be different than the old file: if the
resources of the two files are identical you can replace
the content with what you had; otherwise you must line by
line replace only equal resources, update new resources,
and not add resources that are missing in the new file. 
</font></p>
</blockquote>

<br/>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<font color="red"><b>
Limitation 2
</b></font>
&mdash; it happens that somebody wrongly enters a resource
for a planet where it is not spawning. Assume that someone
reported a resource for Lok, it is not available there but
it is available at several other planets, this will happen:
When SWGAide reads the ISDroid report for Lok it does not
find this resource in the report and concludes that it is
is depleted. Unless SWGAide finds a trace of this resource
at any other planet it is impossible to realize the error.
</font></p>

<blockquote>
<font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Conclusion</b>
&ndash; it is always best to cover all ten core planets at
a time, then SWGAide will find a trace.  
</font>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Fix errors</b>
&ndash; quickly make the resource available (if it became
depleted) and <u>remove</u> the resource from the erratic
planet; notice that remove <i>is not </i> the same as mark
unavailable. Or, post at the resource forum with info on
its galaxy, resource class, name, and which is the wrong
planet.

A droid has two qualities: "charges" (uses per droid), and

time.

&ndash; it is true that ISDroid reports do not read stats
nor way-points, however, together with SWGAide they are
highly useful to help you to stay on top with all current
resources, for all resource classes at the entire galaxy;
see paragraph on Creature Resources. This means, you will
always know about new and depleted resources, and you
can manage your fleet of harvesters most efficiently.

ISDroids do not cover Creature Resources or the planets
Kashyyyk and Mustafar. However, SWGAide provides you with
support also for these resources, see the panel Resources
&raquo; Submit&nbsp;Resources. At that panel you write a
filtered output of resources to the "rem.txt" notes file

determine if they are still in spawn or if you can update
them; see help text for that panel.

How to "fix" an old resource which is wrongly reported at
SWGCraft.org 
</b></font></p>

<font face="Arial" size="-1">
Sometimes a resource is reported with a misspelled name.
Then, if a resource spawns with that name, when and you
try to submit this new resource there is a name clash and
submission fails. The old, faulty resource must be fixed,
partly for its own sake but mainly to make room for the
new resource. Editing a name of an old resource is done
at SWGCraft.org: 
</font>

<ol>
<li><font face="Arial" size="-1">
Use "Find Resources" to find the faulty resource
</font>
</li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="-1">
Click its name to continue to the page where its details
are read; there is a link to "edit" the resource.
</font>
</li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="-1">
Try to find the resource with the help if your "30k Veteran
Resource Crate"; usually the resource class is correct, or
almost correct and possible to guess, so skim through the
resources to find its name, most often only one or a few
letters are wrong and hence easy to find &gt;&gt;&gt;
rectify the name.
</font>
</li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="-1">
Otherwise, rename the erratic resource to something such as
"Yodaerror", if "Yoda" is the faulty name. Then post at the
resource and include galaxy, resource class, and what you
changed the name to; now other players can chime in.
Mention also the new (the old faulty) name for reference.
</font>
</li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="-1">
Now you can submit the new, correct resource.
</font>
</li>
</ol>

<font face="Arial" size="-1">
If there is any other problems with old or new resources,
post at the resource forum so that players, moderators, or
administrators can pitch in to help; always be as detailed
as possible.
