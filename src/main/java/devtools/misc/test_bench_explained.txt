# This calculates the value used for a single slot stat, the same formula is used for all
# Lets use OQ for Ihaomic in a cryo chamber just as an example
# stat and schem values
v = 716            # value of res OQ stat
rescap = 1000      # cap for OQ on this res
units = 8          # number of units this slot calls for
rslots = 4         # number of total res slots in this schem
weight = 33%       # weight of stat for this schem slot
wd = weight / 100  # adjusted weight this schem/slot (snipped to 10 decimals below for brevity)

# u1 u2 u3 u4 etc is the amount of units required for each slot

# formula  (v / rescap * 1000) * (units / (u1+u2+u3+1u4)) * wd
# see below for verbose formula


adjcap = v / rescap * 1000

# add up all units to get total
tunits = 10 + 5 + 8 + 16     # this is your 100% unit quantity  39

# get % of units from slot:
sw = units / tunits     # 8 / 39 comes out with .20512  (I snipped the remaining decimals for brevity)

newvalue = adjcap * sw * wd
#eg 716 * .20512 * .3333333333 = 48.955 which is the res text for OQ you see in test bench. 


# Stat average line on 4 slots with any missing accounted for
# s1 s2 s3 etc come from the above formula (newvalue) for each res slot.
# formula (s1 + s2 + s3 + s4) / (slots - missing) = StatAverage
# verbose formula below.
slots = 4
missing = 0
adjslots = slots - missing    # adjslots is 4
StatAverage = (s1 + s2 + s3 + s4) / adjslots

# repeat above for each stat type that schem calls for (eg CD/SR/UT etc) and for each res slot. 
# In this example we would only need to do CD.

## Add up All Averages
StatAverage1 + StatAverage2 = Overall result.
